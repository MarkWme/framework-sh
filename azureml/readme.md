# Azure ML with AKS

## WIP!

Looks like you need to create a python environment, install PIP 20.1.1, to workaround an issue with the Azure ML SDK.

Alternatively, the az ml extension works for creating a workspace, but looks like the commands for creating / registering models are changing and the docs are not up to date.
